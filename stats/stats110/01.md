# Story Proofs, Axioms of Probability

choosing a team of 4 and a team of 6 from 10 person group can be done by either
$10C4$ or $10C6$ and the values are equivalent; however choosing 2 group of 5
should not be $10C5$ instead it should be $(10C5)/2$ to remove double counting.
the difference here is 4 and 6 are distinct but 5 and 5 are the same.

pick k times from set of n objects where order does not matter and with
replacement. $\binom{n+k-1}{k}$
