# natural language annotation the basics

## layers of linguistic description

- syntax: the study of how words are combined to form sentences. this includes examining part of speech and how they combined to make larger constructions
- semantics: the study of meaning, it examines relation between words and what they are used to represent
- morphology: the study of units of meaning, *morpheme* is the smallest unit of language that has meaning. we have prefixes, suffixes, affixes and other word structure that can impart meaning
- phonology: the study of sound pattern, to know if which phones have significance and have meaning (ie. phonemes); how syllables are structured and combined; and what features are needed to describe the discrete units (segments) in the language, and how they are interpreted
- phonetics: study of sound of human speech, how they are made and received, *phonemes* term for an individual sound or smallest unit of human speech
- lexicon: study of words and phrases used in language / vocab
- discourse analysis: study of exchanges of information, usually in form of conversations and the flow of information across boundaries
- pragmatics: study of how the context affects the meaning of an expression and what information is necessary to infer a hidden or pre supposed meaning (**interesting**)
- text structure analysis: study of narratives and other textual styles are constructed to make larger textual compositions

various combination of the mentioned concepts in the list is possible and will be shown in example projects.

## NLP

the study of language and computational linguistics within the field of AI.

- Question answering systems
- summarization
- machine translation
- speech recognition
- documentation classification

the goal of this book is to gain knowledge to build specialized language corpora, more on NLTK can be found on Natural Language Processing with Python (O'Reilly)

## a brief of history

linguistics was practices primarily as a descriptive field, where we study structural properties within a language and typological variations between languages. models are sophisticated back then. in 1940s, linguists eg. Bloomfield start to think language in a probabilistic manner and in behaviorist terms. this doesn't last as back then there wasn't a lot of data ready available and there is a general shift from data-oriented descriptions of human behavior to introspective modelling of cognitive functions. then in 1950s there was another shift was due to Noam Chomsky (Chomsky 1957) publication that focused on both a formal methodology and theory of linguistics that not only ignored quantitative language data but also claimed that its misleading for formulating models of language behavior.
